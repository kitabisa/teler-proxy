| -c, --conf `<FILE>`        | Specify the path to the teler WAF configuration file                  |
| -f, --format `<FORMAT>`    | Specify the configuration file format (json/yaml) **(default: yaml)** |
| --cert `<FILE>`            | Specify the path to the SSL certificate file                          |
| --key `<FILE>`             | Specify the path to the SSL private key file                          |
| -V, --version              | Display the current teler-proxy version                               |
| -h, --help                 | Display this helps text                                               |

## Configuration

The configuration is provides a comprehensive set of options to fine-tune and tailor the behavior of the teler Web Application Firewall (WAF). Through the use of the teler WAF configuration (`-c`/`--conf`), you gain full control over how the WAF operates and responds to incoming traffic.

In case you opt not to provide a custom configuration file, the teler WAF will seamlessly apply a default configuration, ensuring that your application remains protected with sensible and reasonable settings.

The default configuration options are presented below in YAML format:

```yaml
excludes: []
whitelists: []
customs: []
customs_from_file: ""
log_file: ""
no_stderr: false
no_update_check: false
development: false
in_memory: false
falcosidekick_url: ""
```

Or the equivalent in JSON format:

```json
{
  "excludes": null,
  "whitelists": null,
  "customs": null,
  "customs_from_file": "",
  "log_file": "",
  "no_stderr": false,
  "no_update_check": false,
  "development": false,
  "in_memory": false,
  "falcosidekick_url": ""
}
```

By leveraging this versatile teler WAF configuration, you can fine-tune the WAF to perfectly align with your specific security requirements, ensuring maximum protection for your web service while enjoying the flexibility and power of teler WAF.

### Excludes

Excludes (**excludes**) is a list of threat types (`[]int`) to exclude from the security checks. Please refer to the [docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf@v1.0.4/threat#Threat).

### Whitelists

Whitelists (**whitelists**) is a list of DSL expressions (`[]string`) that match request elements that should be excluded from the security checks. Please refer to the [docs](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf#dsl-expression).

### Customs

Customs (**customs**) is a list of custom security rules (`[]teler.Rule`) to apply to incoming requests.

These rules can be used to create custom security checks or to override the default security checks provided by teler-waf. Please refer to the [docs](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf#custom-rules).

### Customs from File

Customs from file (**customs_from_file**) specifies the file path or glob pattern (`string`) for loading custom security rules. These rules can be used to create custom security checks or to override the default security checks provided by teler IDS.

The glob pattern supports wildcards, allowing you to specify multiple files or a directory with matching files. For example, "/path/to/custom/rules/\**/*.yaml" will load all YAML files in the "rules" directory and its subdirectories. Please refer to the [docs](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf#custom-rules).

### Log File

Log file (**log_file**) is the file path (`string`) for the log file to store the security logs. If `log_file` is specified, log messages will be written to the specified file in addition to stderr (if `no_stderr` is **false**).

### No Stderr

No stderr (**no_stderr**) is a boolean flag indicating whether or not to suppress log messages from being printed to the standard error (stderr) stream.

When set to `true`, log messages will not be printed to stderr. If set to `false`, log messages will be printed to stderr. By default, log messages are printed to stderr (`false`).

### No Update Check

No update check (**no_update_check**) is a boolean flag indicating whether or not to disable automatic threat dataset updates.

When set to `true`, automatic updates will be disabled. If set to `false`, automatic updates will be enabled. By default, automatic updates are enabled (`false`). Please refer to the [docs](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf#datasets).

### Development

Development (**development**) is a boolean flag that determines whether the request is cached or not. By default, development mode is disabled (`false`) or requests will cached. Please refer to the [docs](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf#development).

### In Memory

In memory (**in_memory**) is a boolean flag that specifies whether or not to load the threat dataset into memory on initialization.

When set to `true`, the threat dataset will be loaded into memory, which can be useful when running your service or application on a distroless or runtime image, where file access may be limited or slow. If `in_memory` is set to `false`, the threat dataset will be downloaded and stored under the user-level cache directory on the first startup. Subsequent startups will use the cached dataset. Please refer to the [docs](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf#datasets).

### FalcoSidekick URL

FalcoSidekick URL (**falcosidekick_url**) is the URL of the FalcoSidekick endpoint to which teler-waf's events will be forwarded.

This field should be set to the URL of your FalcoSidekick instance, including the protocol & port (e.g. "http://localhost:2801"). Please refer to the [docs](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf#falco-sidekick).
